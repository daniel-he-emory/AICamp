I am at a 5 hour (AI MCP) hackathon and am building a AI grocery shopping assistant. Basically the app is a conversational agent that acts as an assistant for the user's meal planning and shopping needs. The agent will keep track of the user's shopping history and current state of the pantry/refrigerator and make recommendations for what the user needs to buy for their regular needs. The agent should get to know the user over time and be able to profile the user and understand their dietary needs and preferences and get their input on what they would like. for example, the user might ask the assistant that they want to eat some italian and indian food this week and the agent will (understanding the current state of the pantry) plan the meals (with recipes) for the week and provide exactly what the user needs to buy at a local grocery store so they have enough food that week. this takes away the stress of having to plan for meals and keep track of what ingredients need replenishing. please help us make a roadmap for the app development along with project requirements and a recommended tech stack. keep in mind that this needs to be done quickly (we only have 5 hours) and we should try to use pre-existing tools as much as possible to reduce complexity and time. remember that this is a hackathon for MCP tools. try to use existing tools if they exist rather than making things from scratch if possible. we are going to use the kroger MCP server that allows us to query available groceries at a nearby store and automatically add ingredients to a user's cart.
