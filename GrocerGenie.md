## Project Requirements & Development Guide

### 1. Project Overview

**The Problem:** Meal planning is a recurring, time-consuming task involving recipe discovery, inventory checking, and shopping list creation, often leading to decision fatigue and food waste.

**Our Solution:** GrocerGenie is a smart shopping assistant that streamlines meal planning. It uses a conversational interface to understand user goals and current pantry inventory, intelligently plans meals, generates recipes, produces a precise shopping list of only the missing items, and uses an agentic tool to add those items to a real Kroger shopping cart.

### 2. Core Architecture: State Management

For the agent to have a coherent, multi-turn conversation, it must maintain a session state. This state will be a JSON object that keeps track of the conversation's context.

**session_state Object:**
- **pantry**: A JSON object representing the user's current pantry (e.g., {"onions": 2, "rice (bags)": 1}).
- **current_meal_plan**: A list of the recipes generated in the current request.
- **current_shopping_list**: The list of items needed for the current_meal_plan.
- **user_preferences**: Stores key user info like zip_code for locating a Kroger store.

### 3. Key Features & Development Plan

#### Feature 1: Conversational User Interaction & Intent Recognition

**Description:** The user interacts with GrocerGenie through a chat interface. The backend must determine the user's intent from their natural language messages.

**Development Steps:**
1. **Frontend:** A simple chat UI using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
2. **Backend (Flask):** A single `/chat-with-agent` endpoint that receives user messages.
3. **Intent Recognition (LLM Task):** Use an LLM call to classify the user's message into one of the following intents:
   - `update_pantry`
   - `check_pantry`
   - `request_meal_plan`
   - `add_to_cart`
   - `clarification` (for ambiguous inputs)
4. The backend triggers the appropriate feature logic based on the identified intent.

#### Feature 2: Conversational Pantry Management

**Description:** The agent dynamically populates and manages a pantry.json file through conversation.

**Development Steps:**
1. **Intent Check:** When the intent is `update_pantry`, process the user's message.
2. **Entity Extraction (LLM Task):** Send the user's message to an LLM with a prompt to extract food items, quantities, and the action (add, remove, or update).

   **User Message Example:** "I just bought two onions and a bag of rice, and I finished the milk."

   **Required LLM JSON Output:**
   ```json
   [
     {"item": "onion", "quantity": 2, "action": "add"},
     {"item": "rice", "quantity": 1, "action": "add"},
     {"item": "milk", "quantity": 0, "action": "remove"}
   ]
   ```
3. **Update pantry.json:** Parse the LLM's structured output. For "add", add or increment the item's quantity. For "remove", delete the item or set its quantity to 0.
4. **Confirmation:** Respond to the user with a confirmation message (e.g., "OK, I've added 2 onions and 1 bag of rice to your pantry and removed the milk.").

#### Feature 3: Recipe & Meal Plan Generation

**Description:** Fetches recipes from TheMealDB API based on a user's request.

**Development Steps:**
1. **Intent Check:** On `request_meal_plan`, extract key entities like cuisine type ("italian"), dietary restrictions, or number of meals.
2. **API Integration:** Make a GET request to TheMealDB API.
3. **Select & Parse:** Select the first 2-3 recipes from the API response and parse their data into a structured format (name, image, list of ingredients, and their measures). Store this in the `session_state.current_meal_plan`.

#### Feature 4: Ingredient Analysis & Shopping List Creation

**Description:** Compares the aggregated ingredients from the meal plan against the pantry.json to generate a shopping list of only what is missing.

**Development Steps:**
1. **Aggregate Ingredients:** Combine all ingredients from the `current_meal_plan`.
2. **Ingredient Normalization & Reconciliation (Critical Heuristic):** For each required ingredient, perform the following logic:
   - **a. Basic Match:** Check if a normalized version of the ingredient name exists in the pantry. (e.g., "Onions" â†’ "onion").
   - **b. Synonym Match:** Check for common synonyms (e.g., "ground beef" vs. "beef mince").
   - **c. Quantity Check:** If a match is found, check if the quantity in the pantry is sufficient. This requires simple logic (e.g., if a recipe needs 1 onion and the pantry has 2, the need is met). For the MVP, do not attempt complex unit conversions. Assume a simple count is sufficient.
   - **d. Add to List:** If the item is not in the pantry or the quantity is insufficient, add it to the `current_shopping_list`.
3. **Return Response:** Present the meal plan and the final shopping list to the user in the chat interface.

#### Feature 5: UI Display of Results

**Description:** Dynamically render agent responses in the chat UI.

**Development Steps:**
1. **Structured Backend Responses:** The backend should send messages with a `type` field (e.g., `text`, `meal_plan`).
2. **Frontend Rendering Logic:** JavaScript will check the message type and render the appropriate HTML.
   - `text`: Simple paragraph.
   - `meal_plan`: A series of cards with recipe images, titles, and the final shopping list.

#### Feature 6: Agentic Shopping with Kroger API

* **Description:** After the shopping list is generated and displayed in the chat, the user can command GrocerGenie to add the items to their Kroger cart.  
* **Development Steps:**  
  1. **Setup Kroger MCP Server:** This remains the first priority.  
  2. **User Command:** The user gives a command like, "Okay, add those to my Kroger cart."  
  3. **Agentic Workflow:** The agent identifies the "add to cart" intent and executes the workflow:  
     * Use the search\_products tool for each item on the list.  
     * Collect the productId for each item.  
     * Use the bulk\_add\_to\_cart tool.  
  4. **User Feedback:** The agent reports its progress and success/failure back to the user in the chat interface.  
* **Tools & Options:**  
  * **Primary Tool:** The **Kroger MCP Server**.  
* **Key Considerations & Limitations:**  
  * **Authentication & One-Way Cart:** These remain the same. The agent must handle the auth flow and clearly communicate the limitations of the Kroger API to the user via chat.  
  * **Store Location:** The agent should initiate a conversation to set the user's preferred store if it isn't already set. ("I see you want to shop at Kroger. What is your zip code so I can find the nearest stores?")
